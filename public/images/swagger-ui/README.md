The following images are needed:

1. `swagger-home.png` - Screenshot of the Swagger UI homepage
2. `register-user.png` - Screenshot of the registration endpoint in Swagger
3. `login-user.png` - Screenshot of the login endpoint in Swagger
4. `authenticate.png` - Screenshot showing how to authenticate in Swagger UI
5. `generate-api-key.png` - Screenshot of generating an API key
6. `check-models.png` - Screenshot of the models endpoint
7. `automation-settings.png` - Screenshot of the automation settings
8. `chat-completions.png` - Screenshot of the chat completions endpoint

You can extract these images from the document at `Docs/How-to-use-SwaggerUI` or take new screenshots as needed.
